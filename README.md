# poe_skills_tag_search
A small tool to search Path of Exile skills based on the tags they bear. Now includes a GUI via JavaFX, but it is by no means fancy
since this is my first time I created a GUI.

At the moment there are only the basic tags from the game available for search but I will probably add costum tags
to search in the future. Those would be frenzy charges for example, if this box is ticked it will display all skills
that can create or use a frenzy charge and fit all other parameters.

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions which tags or functionalities might improve the tool (or a good name for it :D) fell free to contact me.
Also if you have any tips on how to make the GUI better I would be very grateful.

Updates since this picture:
- The show Skills button was removed, the list now updates as soon as you tick or untick a checkbox
- Checkboxes that would yield no skills as a result are now disabled
